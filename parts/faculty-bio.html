<p><strong>Teaching Bio</strong><br>Joseph Scott began to play the guitar in his teens, at first self-tutored, passing through phases of folk music and rock and roll, learning by ear while learning to read. After taking a degree in English from the University of Massachusetts, (May 1973), he began another period of exploration including forays into folk music, blues and ragtime, and of course, more rock and roll. At the same time he began his first formal study of the classical guitar, while teaching at home and in music stores and playing and singing in rock bands. Following further private study, and some classroom English teaching, he enrolled in Boston Conservatory, graduating summa cum laude in 1985, in applied classical guitar. Since 1986, Mr. Scott has taught at Cape Cod Conservatory, Powers Music School, Belmont, &nbsp;Franklin School for the Performing Arts, and &nbsp;Milton Academy (1986-2007). In 2007, he joined the faculty of Worcester State College, where he conducts a guitar class, and individual lessons. As a student and practitioner of the Suzuki Method for guitar since 1999, Joe has had his most gratifying teaching successes, assisting students from the earliest stages to advanced ability. He began teaching at the South Shore Conservatory in fall of 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Statement</strong><br>In my work as a teacher of the guitar, I try to help a student discover the beauty of the sound of the instrument and the range of expression it makes possible, while developing a flexible and efficient technique. The instrument is truly the most versatile, and also one of the most challenging, and often requires long exploration and different approaches before a guitarist arrives at what one might call his true voice. In my teaching of students of all ages and backgrounds, I try to find the music and style that will resonate with that particular person to result in joyful music making. In working with young students of the Suzuki guitar method, many beginning at age 6 and continuing through high school, &nbsp;Iâ€™ve experienced the wonderful development of the whole person that can, in part, be attributed to patient guitar study. &nbsp;</p>
